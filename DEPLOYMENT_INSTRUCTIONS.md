# GitHub Pages Deployment Instructions

Follow these steps to deploy your AI Life Coach app to GitHub Pages:

## 1. Run the deployment script

Simply run the `deploy.bat` file by double-clicking on it or running it from the command prompt:

.\deploy.bat
```

This will:

- Add the necessary configuration files to Git

1. Go to your repository settings
2. Scroll down to the "GitHub Pages" section
3. Under "Source", select "GitHub Actions"
